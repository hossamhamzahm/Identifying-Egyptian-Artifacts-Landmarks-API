Abu Simbel, located in southern Egypt, houses two temples built by Ramses II (reigned 1279–13 BCE). The colossal statues of Ramses at the main temple's entrance showcase ancient Egyptian artistry. Rediscovered in 1813 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, the temples were explored in 1817 by Giovanni Battista Belzoni. Carved into a sandstone cliff, the main temple is dedicated to Amon-Re and Re-Horakhte. Graffiti from 6th-century BCE Greek mercenaries and the temple's solar alignment are significant. The smaller temple, north of the main one, honors Nefertari and Hathor. In the 1960s, UNESCO led efforts to relocate and preserve Abu Simbel due to the Aswan High Dam's reservoir.
