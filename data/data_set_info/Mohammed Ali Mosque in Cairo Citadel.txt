The Great Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha, also known as the Alabaster Mosque, is a prominent Ottoman mosque in Cairo's Citadel, commissioned by Muhammad Ali Pasha between 1830 and 1848. Built in memory of his son Tusun Pasha, the mosque stands as a significant landmark and tourist attraction in Cairo. Designed by Yusuf Bushnak, it mirrors the style of Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque. The mosque underwent restoration due to structural issues, completed in 1939. Reflecting Ottoman architecture, it features a central dome, multiple smaller domes, and two towering minarets. Muhammad Ali Pasha's tomb, crafted from Carrara marble, is located in the mosque's courtyard.
