Nefertiti, a queen of Egypt in the 14th century BCE, was the wife of King Akhenaton. Known for her role in the cult of the sun god Aton, her parentage is unclear, but she may have been the daughter of Ay, brother of Akhenaton’s mother. Despite the belief that she acted as queen regnant, evidence is inconclusive, and her political status is unconfirmed. After the disappearance of three princesses and Nefertiti around Akhenaton’s 12th regnal year, it's presumed she died, but there's no record or evidence of her burial. The theory of her separation from Akhenaton is discredited, and speculations about her becoming Smenkhkare are questioned due to archaeological findings.
