Qaitbay Castle, Built by Mamluk Sultan Qaitbay in the 15th century, the Citadel of Qaitbay stands as a formidable fortress on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, safeguarding Alexandria from Crusader threats. Spanning about 2 hectares, its high walls and towers contribute to its status as one of the most significant medieval fortifications globally. Constructed on the site of the ancient Pharos of Alexandria, the Citadel has a history steeped in defense, notably resisting the Ottoman siege of 1517. Today, a World Heritage Site and key tourist attraction, it symbolizes Alexandria's resilience. The Citadel's Mamluk-style Islamic architecture, featuring geometric patterns and crenellations, adds to its allure.
