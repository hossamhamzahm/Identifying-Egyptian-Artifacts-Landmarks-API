The Bibliotheca Alexandrina, stands on Alexandria's historic harbor, paying homage to the city founded by Alexander the Great. Its circular, tilting design, spanning 160 meters in diameter and reaching 32 meters in height, is a tribute to the lost ancient library. The 11-story structure accommodates up to four million books, expandable to eight million with compact storage. Terraced over seven levels, it shields books from harmful light. The reading room, well-lit by north-facing skylights, enhances accessibility. Besides being a library, it houses cultural and educational facilities, such as a planetarium, museums, and an information science school, earning it the Aga Khan Award in 2004.
