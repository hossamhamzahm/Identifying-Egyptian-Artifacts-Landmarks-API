Alhakim bi-Amr Allah, Built in 990 by Caliph Al-Aziz outside the city walls, Al-Hakim Mosque was initially named Al-Anwar, meaning "shining," reflecting the symbolism of light in Shiite philosophy. Later, it was renamed Al-Hakim in tribute to the works by Caliph Al-Hakim. The mosque, located in El Muizz Street within the Badr al-Jamali wall, was constructed between 1087 and 1092. The wall, along the city's northeastern border, features a tower on the north side of the mosque. Inscriptions on minarets and the main entrance provide evidence for its historical periods, confirming its significance in Islamic architecture and history.
