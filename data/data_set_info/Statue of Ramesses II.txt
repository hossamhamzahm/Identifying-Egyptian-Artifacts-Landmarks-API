The Statue of Ramesses II, portrays the king in regal attire, wearing the khepresh crown and holding the heqa sceptre. His transparent ceremonial dress highlights his muscular physique, and he triumphantly tramples the symbols of Egypt's enemies, the Nine Bows, under his sandals. The throne features the sema-tawy, representing the union of Upper and Lower Egypt. Depicting continuity, figures of his wife Nefertari and son Amunherkhepeshef flank his legs. While sharing facial similarities with his predecessor Sethi I, the statue likely belongs to the early reign of Ramesses II. It stands as a symbol of the Museo Egizio, praised for its divine aesthetics by Champollion in 1824.
