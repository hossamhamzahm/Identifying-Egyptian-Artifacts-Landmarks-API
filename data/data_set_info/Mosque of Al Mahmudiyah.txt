The Al-Mahmoudia Mosque, situated in Cairo, Egypt, dates back to 1567 during the Ottoman era, built under Mahmud Pasha's administration. The mosque features unique architecture, combining Mamluk and Ottoman styles, with a distinctive minaret adorned with muqarnas and a cone-shaped obelisk. Mahmud Pasha's mausoleum, accessible through the mosque, is where he is buried after facing accusations and being shot near the mosque. The smaller size of the mosque, compared to others in the area, is due to its construction atop a pile of stones. In 1940, Farouk I undertook restoration work, reinforcing vaults and fixing the ceiling. However, in 2015, the Ministry of Antiquity expressed concerns about the minaret's structural integrity, emphasizing the need for urgent measures to prevent collapse.
