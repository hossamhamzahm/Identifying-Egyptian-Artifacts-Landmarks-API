The Pyramids of Giza, constructed during the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465 BCE), are iconic ancient Egyptian structures located near Al-Jizah on the west bank of the Nile River. Comprising the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), the Pyramid of Khafre (Chephren), and the Pyramid of Menkaure, these colossal structures were designated among the Seven Wonders of the World. Khufu's Great Pyramid is the largest, Khafre's is distinguished by the Sphinx nearby, and Menkaure's is the smallest. Despite looting and weathering, they remain symbolic of Egypt's ancient glory. The site, including nearby pyramids and ruins, achieved UNESCO World Heritage status in 1979.
