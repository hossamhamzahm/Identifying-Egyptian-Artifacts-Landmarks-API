Al Azhar Mosque, one of Cairo's oldest mosques, was constructed in the 10th century under the orders of Fatimid Caliph Sultan al-Muizz li Din Allah. Initially intended as a learning center for the Fatimid Caliphate, it evolved into a global hub for Sunni Islamic scholarship. Remodelled over time, it houses the renowned Al Azhar University, founded in 970 CE and among the world's oldest continuously operating universities. Offering diverse programs, the university covers Islamic studies, Arabic literature, Egyptian history, and comparative religion. With a history spanning over a thousand years, Al Azhar Mosque remains a significant intellectual force in the Muslim world. The Fatimid-style architecture features a large courtyard, five minarets, a central dome, and a capacity for over 20,000 people.
