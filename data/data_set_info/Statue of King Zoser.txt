The statue of King Djoser, discovered in the Serdab northeast of his Saqqara funerary complex, is believed to be the oldest known life-sized Egyptian statue. Seated on his throne and draped in a jubilee cloak, Djoser's statue features deep-set eyes, a ceremonial false beard, and a royal nemes headdress. Little is known about Djoser's early life, but his reign, marked by technological innovation and stability, included the construction of the Step Pyramid at Saqqara—the earliest colossal stone building and first pyramid in Egypt. Djoser's centralized governance, religious reforms, and architectural achievements shaped the Old Kingdom's stability, prosperity, and cultural legacy.
