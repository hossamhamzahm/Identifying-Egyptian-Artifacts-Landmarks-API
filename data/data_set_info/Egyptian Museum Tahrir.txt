The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, located near Tahrir Square, is a renowned institution, initially conceived during Muhammad Ali Pasha's rule (1805-1848) to curb antiquities' export. The first museum, established in 1835, was situated near El-Ezbekia Garden and aimed to showcase Egypt's historical treasures. Under Abbas I in 1851, the collection moved to the Citadel of Salah El-Din but was later gifted to Archduke Maximilian of Austria in 1854. The artifacts now form a significant portion of the Egyptian collection at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the fifth building to house antiquities, has a rich history and remains a prominent cultural institution today.
