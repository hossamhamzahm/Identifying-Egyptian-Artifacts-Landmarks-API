Amenhotep III and Tiye, The colossal statue of Amenhotep III and Tiye, along with their three daughters, is the largest known Ancient Egyptian family group sculpture, showcasing the late 18th Dynasty style with almond-shaped eyes and arched eyebrows. Amenhotep III, wearing the nemes headdress, royal cobra (uraeus), false beard, and kilt, rests his hands on his knees. Queen Tiye, seated to his left with her arm around his waist, matches his height, indicating her prominent status. The three daughters, one standing between the parents' legs, are depicted in various poses, with Princess Henuttaneb portrayed as a queen in a smaller scale. The damaged statues are exhibited in the central hall of the Cairo Museum.
