Hatshepsut, born around 1507 BC, was a significant figure in ancient Egypt as the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Thutmose II and later the fifth Pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Initially serving as regent for her stepson Thutmose III, she eventually assumed the role of pharaoh, adopting the full royal titulary and co-ruling with him. Hatshepsut broke with tradition by taking on masculine roles and representation, portraying herself as a male pharaoh during her prosperous reign. Renowned for large construction projects, including the Karnak Temple Complex and the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, she faced attempts to erase her legacy after death, likely due to religious reasons rather than personal animosity.
