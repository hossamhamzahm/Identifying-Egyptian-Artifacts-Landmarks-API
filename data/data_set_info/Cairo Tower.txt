Cairo Tower, towering at 187 meters, is a historic symbol in the heart of Cairo, Egypt, outreaching the Great Pyramid by 43 meters. Built between 1956 and 1961 with a lotus flower design, it features a rotating restaurant offering panoramic views of Cairo's landmarks. Commissioned by President Gamal Abdel Nasser to defy American pressure, the tower was renovated in 2006 with modern lighting technology. A swift ascent provides visitors with breathtaking views of iconic Egyptian sites, and the circular restaurant on the 14th floor offers a unique dining experience. Cairo Tower stands as a testament to Egypt's rich history, drawing tourists worldwide.
