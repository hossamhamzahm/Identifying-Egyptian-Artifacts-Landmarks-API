The bust of Ramesses II, resembling a Turin Museum statue, features the pharaoh wearing a long wig instead of the Blue Khepresh Crown. Despite a missing nose, the king is depicted with a young face, slight smile, uraeus on the forehead, and a collar of five bead rows over a pleated robe. Renowned as Ramesses the Great, he is celebrated for reclaiming lost lands, expanding borders, initiating the first peace treaty, and prolifically building cities and monuments. Though his tomb was previously plundered, the dramatic rediscovery of Ramesses the Great's mummy cache in 1881 unveiled the preserved remains and treasures.
