Muizz Street, Initiated by Caliph al-Muizz in 970, the reconstruction of Cairo focused on roads, the vital canal system, and a new capital, initially named al-Mu’izziyya al-Qaahirah, later shortened to "al-Qahira." Planned by Jawhar, the city featured central palaces and Bayn al-Qasrayn square. Initially restricted, in 1171, Salah ad-Din opened Cairo to the public, leading to substantial changes and its surpassing of Fustat. Ayubid sultans and Mamluk successors transformed the city, relocating the seat of power to the Citadel. In the 20th century, al-Azhar Street altered the traditional al-Muizz road. Today, Al Muizz street, from Bab al Futuh to Bab al Zuweila, preserves Islamic history and hosts significant monuments and the lively Khan el Khalili market.
