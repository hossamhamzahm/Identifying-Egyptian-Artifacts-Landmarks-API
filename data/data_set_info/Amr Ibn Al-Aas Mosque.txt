The Amr ibn al-As Mosque, constructed in the 7th century AD, holds the distinction of being Egypt and Africa's oldest mosque. Founded by General Amr ibn al-As after the Muslim Arab conquest in 641 AD, it marked the establishment of Fustat, a new city in Egypt. The mosque, the first in old Cairo, has undergone renovations and expansions for centuries but maintains its original design since 1179. Adorned with stunning Islamic calligraphy and geometric patterns, the mosque features a traditional Islamic architectural style with a central courtyard, four minarets, and a domed prayer hall. It remains a significant place of worship and a must-visit for its historical and architectural significance in Cairo.
