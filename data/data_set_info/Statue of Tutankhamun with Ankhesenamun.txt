The Statue of a young Tutankhamun and his consort Ankesenamun at Luxor Temple in Egypt represents the king, who reigned during the 14th century BCE. Tutankhamun, known for his intact tomb discovered in 1922, restored traditional Egyptian religion and art abandoned by his predecessor Akhenaten. The parentage of Tutankhamun remains uncertain, but he married Akhenaten's daughter Ankhesenpaaton. Advised by Ay and Horemheb, Tutankhamun moved his residence to Memphis, changed his name, and restored the old gods' temples. Notable monuments include a palace at Karnak and the Colonnade of the Temple of Luxor, depicting the Opet festival.
