Djoser, the second king of ancient Egypt's 3rd dynasty, is renowned for initiating groundbreaking stone architecture. Ruling for approximately 19 years, he succeeded his brother and was linked through his mother to the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. Collaborating with the skilled architect and physician Imhotep, Djoser constructed an innovative funerary complex at Saqqarah. This complex, a departure from traditional mud bricks, featured the pioneering Step Pyramid—transforming the usual mastaba shape. Surrounding the pyramid were limestone buildings mimicking everyday construction materials, showcasing remarkable technological advancements in stone architecture during Djoser's reign.
