The gold funerary mask of Tutankhamun, a pinnacle of ancient Egyptian artistry from the New Kingdom, served a crucial role in the king's afterlife journey. Unearthed in 1925 by Howard Carter after 3,000 years in tomb KV62, the mask covered Tutankhamun's mummy and offered protection, activated by a magical spell from the Book of the Dead. Symbolically adorned with the uraeus representing both Upper and Lower Egypt, it mirrors the Narmer Palette's message of dominion. Death masks were integral to Egyptian funerary practices, guiding the spirit to its resting place. The mask, displayed in Cairo's Egyptian Museum, exemplifies royal lineage, craftsmanship, and historical significance.
