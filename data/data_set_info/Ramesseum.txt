The Ramesseum, is the funerary temple of Ramses II, built on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes in Upper Egypt. Erected around 1279–13 BC, it features a renowned 57-foot seated statue of Ramses II, dedicated to the god Amon and the deceased king. Notably decorated with reliefs, depicting events like the Battle of Kadesh, Syrian wars, and the Festival of Min, only about half of the temple is preserved. Identified with the "Tomb of Osymandias" mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, the shattered colossus inspired Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem "Ozymandias."
