Hatshepsut, the accomplished female ruler of ancient Egypt, declared herself king during the reign of her stepson Thutmose III, adopting the full pharaoh titulary, including the throne name Maatkare. This life-size statue presents Hatshepsut in the ceremonial attire of an Egyptian king, challenging traditional gender roles. Despite masculine elements, the statue exudes a feminine essence, contrasting with other representations. The throne's kingly titles are feminized, emphasizing her as the "Perfect Goddess, Lady of the Two Lands" and "Bodily Daughter of Re." Traces of blue pigment reveal intricate details, and statues like this, seated and receiving offerings, were likely placed in less public temple areas. Some depict Hatshepsut unequivocally as a woman.
