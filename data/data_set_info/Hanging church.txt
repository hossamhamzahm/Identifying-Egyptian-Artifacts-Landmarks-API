The Hanging Church, among Egypt's oldest, traces its origins to the 2nd century AD and stands atop the ruins of the Roman Babylon Fortress in Coptic Cairo. Notably named for its construction above these ruins, the church boasts a distinctive wooden roof resembling Noah's ark. Entry through iron gates leads to a nineteenth-century facade with twin bell towers. The church contains three sanctuaries dedicated to the Virgin Mary, St. George, and John the Baptist, adorned with painted baldachins. A richly decorated wooden screen features ebony and ivory crosses and precious icons. The oldest section houses sanctuaries, a baptistery, and frescoes depicting the Nativity and apocalypse. Additionally, a first-floor church honors St. Mark.
