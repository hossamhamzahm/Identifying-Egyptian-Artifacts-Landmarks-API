The Babylon Fortress, with roots dating back to Pharaonic times, was mentioned by Ptolemy in his book "Geography." Trajan and Arcadius expanded the fortress, located at the southern end of the town named Babylon, which had a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea. By 335 A.D., Emperor Constantine altered shipping routes from Alexandria to Babylon fortress. In the 5th century, Cyrus, Bishop of Babylon, attended the Council of Ephesus. After the Arab conquest in 641 A.D., the fortress surrendered, becoming a Christian-inhabited quarter named Babylon. Characterized by Roman construction, its towers stand nearly 10 meters high with 3-meter-thick walls.
