The Temple of Hatshepsut, built during her reign (1479-1458 BCE), exemplifies Egypt's monumental building projects. Contrary to misconceptions, these were not constructed by slaves but by skilled and unskilled Egyptian workers as paid labor. These projects fostered unity, pride, and expressed the cultural value of ma'at (harmony). The mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri, designed by Hatshepsut's confidante Senenmut, was modeled after Mentuhotep II's innovative structure. It blended with the landscape and cliffs, serving as both tomb and temple. Senenmut enlarged and embellished every aspect, creating a three-level masterpiece adorned with reliefs, paintings, and statuary. The temple reflected symmetry and showcased Hatshepsut's reign in grandeur and elegance.
