Akhenaten, initially known as Amenhotep IV, was an Egyptian Pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty, succeeding his father Amenhotep III. His reign, approximately from 1367 B.C.E. to 1334 B.C.E., is marked by debates on Egyptian chronology. Akhenaten's chief wife, Nefertiti, gained fame for her beauty. Despite being vilified by successors for neglecting traditional religious practices and introducing monotheistic reforms, Akhenaten is considered an original thinker. His exclusive worship of one God and advocacy of universal values foreshadowed themes later embraced by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Though controversial, his potential influence on the development of these faiths cannot be dismissed.
