The Mosque of Ibn Tulun, Egypt's second-oldest mosque, resides in the former Tulunid capital, Qata'i'. Spanning 26,318 sq m, it features a square plan, a central courtyard with four porticoes, and a distinctive eastern portico. Its exterior boasts 'arais crenellations and arched windows, with 128 pierced-stucco windows on the upper walls. The eastern portico houses decorative mihrabs from the Tulunid, Fatimid, and Mamluk eras. Stucco decorations reveal influences from the Great Mosque of Samarra. The minaret's design mimics Samarra's spiral form. Additions by Sultan Hosam al-Din Lajin in 1297 are notable. Used as a refuge in 1847, the mosque underwent restoration in 1890–1918 and is currently being restored by the High Council for Antiquities.
