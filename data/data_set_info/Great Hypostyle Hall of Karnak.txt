The Great Hypostyle Hall of Karnak, covering 50,000 sq ft, features 134 massive stone columns, with 12 standing at 80 feet high. Built by Seti I, the hall's northern wing showcases inscriptions of Seti's battles. Ramesses II completed the southern wing, usurping his father's decorations. The south wall records Ramesses II's peace treaty with the Hittites. Subsequent pharaohs, including Ramesses III, Ramesses IV, and Ramesses VI, added inscriptions to the walls and columns. The surviving paint on the capitals and the sheer scale of the columns create a monumental atmosphere, emphasizing the grandeur of ancient Egyptian architecture.
